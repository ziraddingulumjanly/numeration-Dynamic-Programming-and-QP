# Optimal Control Methods: Enumeration, Dynamic Programming, and QP

This repository contains descriptive solutions and implementations for optimal control problems using three approaches:
- Enumeration-Based Optimization
- Numerical Dynamic Programming
- Quadratic Programming (QP)

The methods are applied to linear systems with quadratic cost, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and constraint handling.
